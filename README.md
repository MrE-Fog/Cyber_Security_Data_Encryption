Providing security to the data by using AES Algorithm

Encryption attempts to make information unreadable by anyone who is not explicitly authorized to view that data. People or devices can be authorized to access encrypted data in many ways, but typically this access is granted via passwords or decryption keys. There are various strengths and methods of encryption and as technology evolves, older methods of encryption are no longer considered secure. Sensitive information should be encrypted using the best method available whenever possible.

Here I am providing security the data using AES algorithm,providing password to the data and self-destruction of the messages.Actually it is three level security to the data.It works effeciently for the types of the data.
